Plotly is a Python library for creating interactive, web-based data visualizations.
It allows you to build a wide range of interactive plots and dashboards for data exploration and presentation.
Plotly is often used for creating dynamic and interactive charts and graphs for data analysis and reporting. 

- Installation: **pip install plotly**
- Interactive Plots: Plotly specializes in creating interactive plots that allow users to explore data by hovering over data points, zooming, panning, and interacting with the visualization. Interactive plots 
                      are essential for creating dynamic dashboards and web applications.
- Wide Range of Charts: Plotly supports various chart types, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, 3D plots, geographic maps, and more. It's suitable for visualizing a broad 
                       spectrum of data types.
- Customization: Plotly provides a high level of customization for your visualizations. You can control the appearance of data points, lines, colors, labels, and more.
                 It also allows you to use custom CSS for styling.
- Dashboards: Plotly can be integrated with Dash, which is a Python web application framework for creating interactive web-based dashboards. This combination is powerful for building data-driven web applications.
- Wide Language Support: While Plotly is primarily associated with Python, it supports multiple programming languages, including R, Julia, and JavaScript. This makes it a versatile choice for data visualization across different ecosystems.
- Export and Sharing: You can export Plotly plots and dashboards as HTML files, images, or interactive web applications. This allows you to easily share your visualizations with others.
- Community and Community Charts: Plotly has an active and growing community, and it provides an online charting platform (Plotly Chart Studio) where you can create and share interactive charts and visualizations.
- Integration with Pandas: Plotly can work well with Pandas DataFrames, making it easy to create interactive plots from structured data.
